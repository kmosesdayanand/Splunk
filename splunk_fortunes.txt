You had me at source=*.

%
My dashboard doesn't lie. Yours is... optimistic.
%
Your favorite superhero? Mine’s the Indexer.

%
“Working as intended” — until Splunk says otherwise.
%

Logs are my love language.
%
I whisper sweet SPL to my data.

%
My hobbies include indexing, parsing, and not panicking.
%
Why socialize when you can normalize?
%
My Splunk queries are longer than my resume.
%
I tried to relax once. Then an alert went off.
%
Don’t just stand there! There’s an unknown sourcetype out there!
%
I didn’t choose the Splunk life. It chose me after a 2AM outage.
%
If you listen closely, you can hear the logs crying for context.
%

Splunkers do it with dashboards and real-time alerts.
%
You haven't truly lived until you’ve fixed broken parsing at 2 AM.
%
In a world of data, be a search head.

You're only as good as your last successful alert.
%
Silence isn’t golden. It’s an offline forwarder.
